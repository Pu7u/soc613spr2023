ERGM Exercise.

What factors contribute to the structure of an advice and collaboration network?

The data for this exercise consist of doctors sharing information. The data were collected in 1966 be a team 
led by James Coleman (Coleman, Katz & Menzel). The group collected data on the doctors' adoption of a new
drug, tetracylcine. 

They were asked: When you need information or advice about questions of therapy where do you usually turn?" 

"And who are the three or four physicians with whom you most often find yourself discussing cases or therapy 
in the course of an ordinary week – last week for instance?" 

And third: "Would you tell me the first names of your three friends whom you see most often socially?"

I have summed these matrices in the cmk_mat matrix stored in CKM_data.Rdata.

Additional variables per doctor are stoded in the CKM dataframe. We will be using "community" and "city." See codes below.

First, make a network object in statnet and draw the graph.

We will see that there are four main components.

Let's try to estimate the factors contributing to the Peoria subgraph.

First, shrink the graph(hint: get.inducedSubgraph(ckm_net,v=which(ckm_net%v%'city'==1))

Now answer the following questions.

1. Build a baseline model that describes how density relates to the Peoria Doctors Graph

2. Add the effect of homophily on time in the community

3. Add the effect of local clustering and control for any model degeneracy.

4. Does reciprocity (or mutuality) play a role in structuring this network? 


The codes are:

City (: 1 Peoria, 2 Bloomington, 3 Quincy, 4 Galesburg)

Community:

How long have you been practicing in this community?

1	a year or less
2	more than a year, up to two years
3	more than two years, up to five years
4	more than five years, up to ten years
5	more than ten years, up to twenty years
6	more than twenty years
9	no answer
